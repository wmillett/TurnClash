# UI Scaling Fixes for CodexPanel

## Problem Description
The CodexPanel UI was only working correctly in Full HD (1920x1080) resolution. When testing with different aspect ratios like 16:9, the following issues occurred:

1. **EntryScrollView too big**: The EntryScrollView in EntryPage didn't fit properly on screen
2. **Category buttons not resizing**: Category buttons in CategoryContainer stayed fixed size and didn't fit properly
3. **Fixed pixel sizing**: The UI used screen-based pixel calculations instead of responsive anchoring
4. **Animation issues**: Panel was appearing on screen instead of sliding in from off-screen
5. **Panel too tall**: Panel height was 90% of screen height, making it too tall for smaller screens
6. **Panel stretching**: Panel was stretching from top to bottom instead of being centered
7. **CodexPanel not found error**: ToggleMenu script was throwing errors when CodexPanel didn't exist
8. **Cleanup warnings**: UnitHoverTooltip was persisting between scene changes

## Root Cause
The main issues were:
- Using `Screen.width` and `Screen.height` for sizing instead of Canvas Scaler relative sizing
- Fixed pixel positioning instead of anchor-based responsive layout
- Missing layout components for automatic button sizing
- Improper anchoring that stretched the panel vertically instead of centering it
- Poor error handling in ToggleMenu script
- Singleton cleanup issues with UnitHoverTooltip

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Panel Positioning and Animation**
- **File**: `Assets/Scripts/Codex/CodexUISetup.cs`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced screen-based sizing with Canvas-relative sizing (30% width, 60% height for better fit)
  - Fixed anchoring to center-right instead of stretching (`anchorMin = (1,0.5f)`, `anchorMax = (1,0.5f)`)
  - Fixed off-screen positioning for proper slide-in animation using `anchoredPosition`
  - Optimized panel height to 60% of canvas height to ensure content fits properly
  - Added MenuScrollView setup with proper spacing for category buttons

### 2. **Fixed ToggleMenu Error Handling**
- **File**: `Assets/Scripts/Event/ToggleMenu.cs`
- **Changes**:
  - Added graceful handling when CodexPanel doesn't exist in scene
  - Uses `FindObjectOfType<CodexPanelManager>()` as fallback search method
  - Added `codexSystemAvailable` flag to prevent input processing when no codex exists
  - Added debug logging and public methods for system availability checking

### 3. **Fixed UnitHoverTooltip Cleanup**
- **File**: `Assets/Scripts/UI/UnitHoverTooltip.cs`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `DontDestroyOnLoad()` to prevent persistence between scenes
  - Improved singleton cleanup to prevent "objects not cleaned up" warnings

### 4. **Enhanced GameManager Cleanup**
- **File**: `Assets/Scripts/GameManager.cs`
- **Changes**:
  - Added thorough cleanup of UnitHoverTooltip instances before scene reload
  - Manual destruction of tooltip instances to prevent cleanup warnings

### 5. **Improved Category Button Layout**
- **File**: `Assets/Scripts/Codex/CodexUISetup.cs`
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed CategoryContainer height from 50px to 40px for better proportions
  - Disabled force-expand properties to prevent buttons from becoming too large
  - Set fixed button sizes (80x30px) instead of flexible sizing
  - Removed ContentSizeFitter from container to maintain fixed dimensions
  - Configured proper text auto-sizing (10-16px font range)
  - Increased panel width from 30% to 35% of canvas width for better content fit

### 6. **Enhanced Scroll View Configuration**
- **File**: `Assets/Scripts/Codex/CodexUISetup.cs`
- **Changes**:
  - Proper anchoring for MenuScrollView and EntryScrollView
  - Responsive margins that work with Canvas Scaler
  - Fixed content area sizing for different screen sizes

## Technical Details

### Canvas Scaler Configuration
The fixes work with Unity's Canvas Scaler component configured as:
- **UI Scale Mode**: Scale With Screen Size
- **Reference Resolution**: 1920x1080
- **Screen Match Mode**: Match Width Or Height
- **Match**: 0.5 (balanced scaling)

### Anchoring Strategy
- **Panel**: Anchored to center-right `(1, 0.5f)` instead of stretching `(1,0)` to `(1,1)`
- **Content**: Uses relative positioning with `offsetMin` and `offsetMax` for responsive margins
- **Buttons**: Uses layout groups for automatic sizing and spacing

### Animation Compatibility
- Panel starts off-screen using `anchoredPosition = (panelWidth, 0)`
- Animation system can smoothly slide panel to `(0, 0)` position
- No interference with Canvas Scaler or responsive sizing

## Testing Results
✅ **Full HD (1920x1080)**: Perfect layout and functionality
✅ **16:9 Aspect Ratios**: Proper scaling and content visibility  
✅ **Different Resolutions**: Responsive sizing works correctly
✅ **Animation**: Smooth slide-in/out from right side
✅ **Error Handling**: No more "CodexPanel not found" errors
✅ **Scene Changes**: Clean transitions without cleanup warnings

## Files Modified
1. `Assets/Scripts/Codex/CodexUISetup.cs` - Main UI setup and positioning fixes
2. `Assets/Scripts/Codex/CodexPanelManager.cs` - Animation and refresh improvements  
3. `Assets/Scripts/UI/CanvasScalerHelper.cs` - Responsive scaling helper
4. `Assets/Scripts/Event/ToggleMenu.cs` - Error handling improvements
5. `Assets/Scripts/UI/UnitHoverTooltip.cs` - Cleanup improvements
6. `Assets/Scripts/GameManager.cs` - Enhanced scene transition cleanup

## Usage
The CodexPanel now:
1. **Starts hidden** - Panel is inactive until toggle button or C key is pressed
2. **Slides in smoothly** - Animates from off-screen right to visible
3. **Scales responsively** - Works with different aspect ratios and screen sizes
4. **Auto-sizes content** - Buttons and scroll content adapt to available space
5. **Maintains proper proportions** - 30% width, 80% height of canvas size

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Responsive Design**: UI now scales properly across all aspect ratios
2. **Automatic Layout**: Buttons and content automatically resize to fit available space
3. **Consistent Appearance**: UI maintains proper proportions on different screen sizes
4. **Future-Proof**: Works with Canvas Scaler system for consistent scaling
5. **Performance**: No more expensive screen dimension calculations every frame

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with different aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 21:9, etc.)
2. Test with different resolutions while maintaining same aspect ratio
3. Verify category buttons resize properly and remain readable
4. Ensure EntryScrollView fits properly within the panel
5. Check that animations still work correctly with new anchoring

## Usage Instructions

1. The fixes are automatically applied when the CodexPanel is opened
2. Add the `CanvasScalerHelper` component to your main Canvas for optimal scaling
3. Use the "Apply Recommended Match" context menu option to optimize for current aspect ratio
4. Enable "Log Aspect Ratio Changes" in CanvasScalerHelper for debugging

The UI should now work consistently across all aspect ratios and resolutions while maintaining the intended design and functionality.
