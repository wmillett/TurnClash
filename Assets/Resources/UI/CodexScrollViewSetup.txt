Codex Scroll View Setup Instructions
===================================

Follow these steps to set up the scrollable content view in the CodexPanel's MenuPage:

1. Add Scroll View to MenuPage:

   - Select the existing "MenuPage" GameObject in the CodexPanel hierarchy
   - Right-click on MenuPage and select UI â†’ Scroll View
   - Rename the newly created ScrollView to "ScrollView"
   - Position it to fill most of the MenuPage (leave room at the top for category buttons)

2. Configure the Scroll View:

   - Set the Scroll View's Anchor Points to stretch (Min: 0,0 and Max: 1,1)
   - Set Margins to something like (Left: 20, Right: 20, Top: 80, Bottom: 20)
   - Make sure "Vertical" scrolling is enabled and "Horizontal" is disabled
   - Set the "Movement Type" to "Elastic" for better feel
   - Set "Scrollbar Visibility" to "AutoHideAndExpandViewport"
   - Adjust the "Elasticity" to around 0.1 for smoother scrolling
   - Check "Inertia" to enable momentum-based scrolling

3. Style the Scroll View:

   - Select the "Scrollbar Vertical" inside the ScrollView
   - Adjust width to around 15 pixels for a sleeker look
   - Change the scrollbar colors to match your UI theme
   - Consider adjusting the "Handle" size for aesthetics

4. Configure the Content Container:

   - Select the "Content" GameObject inside the Viewport
   - Set anchor points to (Min: 0,1 and Max: 1,1) - anchoring to top
   - Set pivot to (0.5, 1) - top center
   - Reset position to X: 0, Y: 0
   - Leave the height relatively small (will be expanded by code)
   - Add a Vertical Layout Group component if you want automatic positioning
   - If using Layout Group, set:
     * Padding: 15 on all sides
     * Spacing: 15
     * Child Alignment: Upper Center
     * Child Force Expand Width: true
     * Child Force Expand Height: false
     * Child Control Width: true
     * Child Control Height: false

5. Add the CodexScrollView Component:

   - Make sure the ScrollView has the CodexScrollView component attached (this happens automatically)
   - If you want to use a prefab for entry items:
     * Create a prefab with a Button and TextMeshPro Text
     * Assign this prefab to the "Entry Prefab" field in the CodexScrollView component
   - Otherwise, the component will create buttons dynamically

6. Final Adjustments:

   - Test the scroll view by running the game
   - Make sure the CodexPanelManager is finding the ScrollView properly
   - Ensure buttons are being created and visible
   - Adjust scrolling speed if needed
   - Make sure the scroll view doesn't interfere with other UI elements

Troubleshooting:
- If entries don't appear, check the Console for errors
- Verify your JSON data is loading correctly
- Make sure the Content container's anchoring is set properly
- Check that the ScrollView is active and visible
- Ensure the CodexScrollView component is attached
